# Quick Fixes Being Applied

## What I'm Fixing Right Now:

1. ✅ User profile button navigation (DONE)
2. ✅ Notification badge removed (DONE)
3. ✅ Comments system working (DONE)
4. 🔄 Search page with real data (IN PROGRESS)
5. 🔄 Sorting functionality (IN PROGRESS)
6. 🔄 Load more posts (IN PROGRESS)
7. 🔄 Real trending data (IN PROGRESS)

## What Requires More Time:

The following features you requested are MAJOR additions that require:
- New database tables (already added to schema)
- Multiple new pages
- Complex UI components
- Extensive testing

### These Include:
- Follow/connection system
- App posting & review system
- Complete settings restructure
- Advanced search with filters
- Chat/messaging system

## Recommendation:

Let me implement the critical fixes first (search, sorting, load more, real data).

Then we can tackle the major features one at a time:
1. Follow system
2. App posting
3. Settings restructure
4. Advanced features

This ensures everything works properly and is tested.

**Should I continue with just the critical fixes, or do you want me to attempt all features at once?**

The risk of doing everything at once is:
- Potential bugs
- Incomplete features
- Harder to test
- May break existing functionality

Let me know your preference!
